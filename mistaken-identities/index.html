                <div id="action">The art piece titled Mistaken Identities, created in 1996, is Tamblyn's second CD-ROM which is a setup comparison between the life stories of ten prominent women. Josephine Baker, Simone de Beauvoir, Catherine the Great, Colette, Marie Curie, Marlene Dietrich, Isadora Duncan, Frida Kahlo, Margaret Mead, and Gertrude Stein are all featured in this piece. The purpose of this art piece is to dis­cover bridges that link the lives of these women, using the CD-ROM format’s branching structure to create parallels and overlaps among their stories. The CD-ROM explores the 10 women portrayed in this artwork as multifaceted individuals whose identities are contingent rather than fixed. The women were selected for this piece based on their high standing as female role models. Each of these women got her power from her ability to constantly reinvent herself in response to the pressures of society. Each one of these women featured also made a great contribution to our culture and society. The project has six sections to it, those being the Portrait Gallery, the Timeline, the Scrapbook, TV Movies, Morphologies, and the Puzzle. This piece is comprised of a variety of artistic mediums such as text, sound, graphics, and QuickTime movies interactively. The Portrait Gallery has archival photo­graphs in a montage format. I wanted to highlight a couple of the cool features of the art piece one of them being The Puzzle. The Puzzle engages viewers as active participants by presenting them with the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle to be assembled. A QuickTime movie starts every time a component fits into position. These films feature performance scenes centered around the manipulation of fetishes like pens, playing cards, lipstick, cigarettes, mirrors, and kisses. These stand-in items reinscribe the sensuality that virtual media frequently lacks. Another part of this art piece that is interesting is The Scrapbook. Snapshots of the women's everyday life are combined with quotes from their autobiographical writings in The Scrapbook. A pause occurs between the text and the images, and it is enhanced by the author's intervention, which is accomplished by adding sound effects. To increase polyphonic dissonances, these sound effects can reinforce or counteract the atmosphere that the text and images have created.
