                    <div id="action">Christine Tamblyn was born on July 12, 1951 in Waukegan, Illinois. She was an American feminist media artist, critic, and educator. As a child, Tamblyn was shy and introverted. She moved from Waukegan to Chicago in 1968 and began to audit courses at the University of Chicago. In 1973 she began undergraduate studies at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where she focused on video and performance because of what she saw as their connections to everyday life. During this period, she was greatly influenced by the work of Allan Kaprow and what was happening during the 1950s to 1960s. In 1979, graduated from SAIC and moved to New York and pursued her performance work in East Village spaces. While living in New York she taught for many years at the School of Visual Arts. By the 1980s, Tamblyn had become interested in curatorial work. She went to graduate school at the University of California, San Diego, and continued her studies there learning from other amazing artists. She received her M.F.A. degree in 1986. Throughout the 90s, Tamblyn was a faculty at San Francisco State University, hired as an assistant professor at Florida International University, Miami, and lastly took up an assistant professorship in the Department of Studio Art at the University of California, Irvine. Tamblyn passed away in San Francisco in 1998 but her archive is held by the University of California, Irvine to this day.<br>Tamblyn was a visual artist who worked in performance and new media and was at the forefront of those experimenting with video and computer technologies for the creation of conceptual art. Tamblyn argued that the emergence of computer art represented the apogee of the 20th century's conceptual art movement. Many of the works Tamblyn did were autobiographically inflected, including the CD-ROM projects She Loves It, She Loves It Not: Women and Technology (1993), and Mistaken Identities (1995). By including personal materials such as childhood journals, Tamblyn underlined the fact that interactive media do not provide a space of absolute freedom for the viewer but instead offer a structure that complexly links the viewer to the artist.
