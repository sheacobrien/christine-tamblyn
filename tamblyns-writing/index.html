            <div id="action">Not only was Christine Tamblyn an incredible artist but she was also a writer. After reading much of her writing I can see the connection between her beliefs and values through her art, such as her being a feminist and a women's rights activist. In an article I found titled, “No More Nice Girls: Recet Transgressive Feminist Art”, she begins the article by writing in italics, “Two Bad Daughters; No More Nice Girls; Mayhem; The Constant State of Desire” in which she aims to demonstrate some of the ways that women are described. Within her piece, she writes about the emergence of transgressive feminist art in contemporary society. She writes feminist art has moved past conventional depictions of gender equality and adopted more radical and aggressive modalities of expression. Tamblyn emphasizes how crucial it is for artists to continue to reinvent the feminist movement in the current period, starting discourse, and upending power structures. Tamblyn highlights the importance of women figures within our society through her art as well as her writing.
